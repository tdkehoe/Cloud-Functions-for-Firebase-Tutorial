# Cloud Functions for Firebase Tutorial

My preferred tech stack is Angular (front end), Material (design and UI library), Firebase databases, and Firebase Cloud Functions. The Cloud Functions call APIs such as Google Cloud Translation and IBM Watson Speech-to-Text. You don't want to call APIs from your front end because this exposes your API keys or other credentials. You can safely call APIs from your back end, get the data, process the data, and write the data to your databases or send the data to your front end.
